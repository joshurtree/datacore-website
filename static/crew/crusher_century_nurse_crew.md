She's pretty good, I swear! It's not her fault her most noteworthy aspects are the ways the studio botched her card. Let's start with the creepy "staring at the camera art" which they didn't even get licensed properly in time for her event announcement, leading to a ranked reward chart devoid of a gold card when it went live. Unable to see her art initially, one would next notice her name "Century Nurse" which may be the worst name ever for a card in this game. Finally there's her skill set and order, which is a direct (dare I say lazy?) copy of her most recent prior variant, Caldos IV Crusher. 

If you can overlook the disappointment of Century's power being a direct downgrade from Caldos IV's, you'll see that Century is quite decent in her own right. Debuting with middling voyage power doesn't scream "great investment," but she'll be usable for a while. Like her big sister, her traits aren't very eventable but will do very well for voyage antimatter bonuses. For collections, she gives up Physician for the more valuable Costumed, which at launch is the largest collection in game. Plus she comes from a fun episode! One could do far worse than her to climb the Costumed ranks to 100.
