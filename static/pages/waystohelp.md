## Ways to help
There are numerous ways to help improve this website. All contributions large or small are welcome.

### Suggestions and problems
If you have encountered a problem or have an idea you think could improve your experiance of this site then feel free to go on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8Du7ZtJ) or submit your suggestion on [Github](https://github.com/stt-datacore/website/issues).

### Development
The project is [open source](https://github.com/stt-datacore) so we're open for contributions from software engineers, designers, devops, testers and so on. Reach out on our [development Discord](https://discord.gg/2SY8W7Aeme) if you're not sure where to start.

If you've always wanted a feature on DataCore, here's your chance to hack on the project and implement it yourself! Most of the project is written in TypeScript, with node.js on the backend and React with Gatsby on the frontend.

### Testing
If you want to set up and try out the latest experimental versions or run your own personal version of the site then you can find out how to do this [here](https://github.com/stt-datacore/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Documentation
We are continually striving to make the site as well as contributing to project more user friendly. Documentation is vital to achieving this goal. The current state of the documentation can be viewed [here](https://github.com/stt-datacore/wiki/wiki). If you feel you can make improvements you can go to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2SY8W7Aeme) and request access.
